This is a Java written applet. DataWindow.java provides the interface for the 
app. DataContainer.java provides the GUI component that holds the output
values. DataProcessor.java holds all functions to do calculations at real time.
These functions are called by DataWindow.java through an action listener of
button presses. objectdraw.jar is the library used for most of the GUI
components. The buttons, labels, and text fields used are from swing. Data is
processed through Java's built-in array list data structure. Since this is an
applet, it is executed via .html file. This applet can be displayed on web 
pages. GUI components are called from main libraries using built-in constructors
and functions I wrote are called in the interface; all implementations of
object-oriented programming.
